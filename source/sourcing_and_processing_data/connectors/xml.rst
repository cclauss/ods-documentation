XML connector
=============

This connector can create a dataset from an XML document.

The provided document can have tags with arbitrary names but there are some constraints on the structure :

- it must contain an array of objects, each object being used to create a record in the dataset,
- the array can be anywhere in the XML document and can have any name,
- the objects must be flat, which means all their attributes must be at the root of the object,
- the first few objects must have all the attributes present in the file so the dataset's columns are correctly discovered.

Configuration
-------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * * Name
     * Description
     * Values
   * * Object path
     * Path to the first object in the XML document
     * e.g. /{namespace}arrayTag/objectTag

Example file
------------

.. code-block:: xml
    :linenos:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <id>abcdef123</id>
    <description>A shopping list</description>
    <basket>
        <itemCount>3</itemCount>
        <totalQuantity>19</totalQuantity>
        <item>
            <name>tomato</name>
            <quantity>10</quantity>
        </item>
        <item>
            <name>potato</name>
            <quantity>5</quantity>
        </item>
        <item>
            <name>banana</name>
            <quantity>4</quantity>
        </item>
    </basket>

In this example:

- the root tag of the records is "basket" (line 4),
- the tag of the objects is "item",
- each object has a "name" and a "quantity attribute".

The object path is "/basket/item".

Please note that tags **id**, **description**, **itemCount** and **totalQuantity** (tag names are arbitrary) will be ignored because they are not in any object.
