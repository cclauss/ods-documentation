JSON connectors
===============

JSON is an open-standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of keyâ€“value pairs. It is the most common data format to build web APIs.

As JSON documents can have a lot of different forms, there are two JSON connectors you can choose to extract your data. If the connector did not manage to fully extract a document with a complex structure, you can use one of the platform's JSON processors to complete the extraction.

JSON File
---------

This connector extracts a valid JSON document (array or object) into one dataset of several records.

- If the document is a JSON array, a record will be created for each object inside the array (the keys will be used as column names).
- If the document is a JSON object, the parameter "JSON root" should contain a dot-separated path to the array inside your object. If not provided, the connector tries `items`.

For each item inside the array, the connector can follow another path before extracting the records thanks to the parameter "JSON object".

Supported field types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- regular fields like decimal, bool, string
- JSON object: will be used as-is
- array:
    - if the array contains JSON objects, it will be used as-is
    - if it contains strings, a multivalued field will be created with all the strings separated by a semicolon (";")

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * * Name
     * Description
     * Values
   * * JSON root
     * Path to the json array on which the connector will iterate to get the records
     * None if JSON array, "items" if JSON object
   * * JSON object
     * Relative path of the json object you want to extract (from JSON root)
     *

JSON Line
---------

This connector expects a file in which each line is a one-line JSON documents. The whole file is not a valid JSON document but each line is.

The connector supports two modes:
    - One JSON array on each line (or one array altogether)
    - One JSON object on each line

Supported field types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- regular fields like decimal, string
- array: will be used as-is
- JSON object: will be used as-is
