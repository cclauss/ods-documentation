Introducing OpenDataSoft
========================

OpenDataSoft is a platform that has been specifically designed for non-technical business users to share, publish and 
reuse structured data.

SaaS-based and with a cost-effective approach, it is the perfect solution to get the best out of data collection, 
transformation and sharing.

No need for intense training. Only a few hours are necessary to be fully up to speed.

* Business users can publish and transform datasets.
* Reusers can share easy-to-understand interactive data visualizations on the Web.
* Developers can integrate heterogeneous datasets into Web and mobile applications.
 
The OpenDataSoft platform can be used to build public Open Data portals, internal data management repositories, smart 
cities platforms, data market places...

The graph below displays the platform architecture in a simple way.

The OpenDataSoft platform is unique because it gathers in one single software all the features business users need to 
make value out of their data.

Of course, it might not be suitable for every data management use case: the setup of a dedicated ETL, BI platform, Big 
Data Analytics tool... can still be required. But whatever the case, OpenDataSoft can be used as the best complementary 
solution to ease the publishing workflow.

To sum up, if you have data, if you have applicative business use cases but no solution to fill the gap between your 
data and your applications, you are at the right place!
