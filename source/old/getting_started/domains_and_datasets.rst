Domains and Datasets
====================

This article aims at introducing the basic concepts you need to understand when using the OpenDataSoft platform:

* **Domain**
* **Dataset**
* **Metadata**
* **Record**

When you subscribe to a given OpenDataSoft plan, you actually become the administrator of an OpenDataSoft **domain**.

A domain is accessible through its fully qualified DNS name, for instance: **mydomain.opendatasoft.com**. A domain can 
of course be given alternate name and you can even use CNAME aliases to have you owned domain refer to an OpenDataSoft 
domain.

A domain contains datasets. The set of datasets belonging to a domain is often called the **datasets catalog**.

A dataset is described by a set of metadata, such as its title, publishing date, license, etc.

A dataset itself contains structured records. The structure of the records contained within a dataset are defined by 
the **dataset schema** (think of it as a RDBMS table schema).
