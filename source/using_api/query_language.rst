Query Language
==============

Filtering features are built in the core of OpenDataSoft API engine. Many of the previously listed APIs can take as a 
parameter filters for constraining the list of returned datasets or records.

Note that a given filtering context can simply be copied from one API to another. For example, you can easily build a 
user interface which first allows the user to visually select the records their are interested in, using full text 
search, facets and geo filtering, and then allowing them to download these records with the same filtering context.

The OpenDataSoft query language makes it possible to express complex boolean conditions as a filtering context.

The user query can most of the time be expressed through the ``q`` HTTP parameter.

Full-text search
----------------

The query language accepts full text queries.

This query returns all results that contain all words passed in the query.
If a given word or compounds is surrounded with double quotes, it performs an ``AND`` query on each tokenized word.

* ``q=film`` returns results that contain film
* ``q="action movies"`` returns results that contain action and movies.

It is possible to perform a greedy query by adding a wildcard `*` at the end of a word.

* ``q=film*`` returns results that contain film, films, filmography...

Boolean expressions
-------------------

The query language supports the following boolean operators ``AND``, ``OR`` and ``NOT``.

Parenthesis can be used to group together expressions and alter the default priority model:

* ``NOT``
* ``AND``
* ``OR``

Samples

* ``film OR trees``
* ``(film OR trees) AND paris``

Field queries
-------------

One of the major feature of the query language is to allow per field filtering. You can use field names as a prefix to 
your queries to filter the results based on a specific field's value.

**For the dataset search API**, the list of available fields corresponds exactly to available metadata. By default:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * * Field Name
     * Description
   * * publisher
     * The dataset publisher
   * * title
     * The dataset title
   * * description
     * The dataset description
   * * license
     * The dataset license
   * * records_count
     * The number of records in the dataset
   * * modified
     * The last modification date of the dataset
   * * language
     * The language of the dataset (iso code)
   * * theme
     * The theme of the dataset
   * * references
     * The references for the dataset

The domain administrator might define a richer metadata template, thus giving acces to a richer set of filtering fields.

For example, one can search on public.opendatasoft.com datasets which have ``Paris`` in their title or description and 
which contain at least 50 000 records:
 
``(title:paris OR decription:paris) AND records_count >= 50 000`` 
http://public.opendatasoft.com/api/v2/catalog/datasets?q=(title:paris%20OR%20decription:paris)%20AND%20records_count%20\>=%2050000

**For the record search APIs**, the list of available fields depend on the schema of the dataset. To fetch the list of 
available fields for a given dataset, you may use the search dataset or lookup dataset APIs.

For example one can search in the dataset containing the movies shooting spots in Paris in the last decade any film 
directed by Woody Allen: 
`<http://public.opendatasoft.com/api/v2/catalog/datasets/tournagesdefilmsparis2011/records?q=realisateur%3A%22woody+allen%22>`_.

Multiple operator fields can be used between the field name and the query depending of the type

Text field
~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * * Operators
     * Description
   * * ``:``
     * Perform a normalized query on provided token. Example: ``film_name:star`` will match ``star wars`` and ``Star Trek``
       To match multi tokens, it is possible to use quotes. ``film_name:"star wars"`` will match fields containing ``star`` and ``wars``
   * * ``=``
     * Perform an exact query (not tokenized and not normalized) on the specified field.
       Example: ``film_name=Star`` will not match ``Star Wars``. To match ``Star Wars`` it is possible to use quotes.
       ``film_name="Star Wars``

Numeric field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * * Operators
     * Description
   * * ``:``, ``=``
     * Match a numeric value. For instance: ``age:18`` will filter rows with field ``age`` is equals to ``18``
   * * ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``
     * Return results whose field values are larger, smaller, larger or equal, smaller or equal to the given value.
   * * ``[lower_numeric (TO|..) higher_numeric]``
     * Queries Records whose numeric value is between ``lower_numeric`` and ``higher_numeric``.
       An inclusive or exclusive bound can be used. Example: ``]lower_numeric (TO|..) higher_numeric[`` will exclude ``lower_numeric`` and ``higher_numeric``.


Date field
~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * * Operators
     * Description
   * * ``:``, ``=``
     * Match a date value. For instance: ``film_date:1977`` will return films released in 1977.
   * * ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``
     * Return results whose field values are larger, smaller, larger or equal, smaller or equal to the given value.
   * * ``[lower_date (TO|..) higher_date]``
     * Queries Records whose numeric value is between ``lower_date`` and ``higher_date``.
       An inclusive or exclusive bound can be used. Example: ``]lower_numeric (TO|..) higher_numeric[`` will exclude ``lower_date`` and ``higher_date``.



Date formats can be specified in different formats: simple (YYYY[[/mm]/dd]) or ISO 8601 (YYYY-mm-DDTHH:MM:SS)

Examples:

* ``film_date >= 2002``
* ``film_date >= 2013/02/11``
* ``film_date: [1950 TO 2000]``
* ``film_box_office > 10000 AND film_date < 1965``


Query language functions
------------------------

Advanced functions can be used in the query language. Function names need to be prefixed with a sharp (``#``) sign.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * * Function name
     * Description
   * * now
     * Returns the current date. This function may be called as a query value for a field. When called without an 
       argument, it will evaluate to the current datetime: ``birthdate >= #now()`` returns all Records 
       containing a birth date greater or equal to the current datetime. This function can also accept parameters, see 
       below for the ``#now`` function available parameters.
   * * null
     * This function may be called specifying a field name as a parameter. It returns the hits for which no value is 
       defined for the specified field. For example ``#null(birthdate)``

**Available parameters for the ``#now`` function**:Ã’

* years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds: These parameters add time to the current date.

  For example: ``#now(years=-1, hours=-1)`` returns the current date minus a year and an hour

* year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond: can also be used to specify an absolute date.

  For example: ``#now(year=2001)`` returns the current time, day and month for year 2001

* weekday: Specifies a day of the week. This parameter accepts either an integer between 0 and 6 (where 0 is Monday and 
  6 is Sunday) or the first two letters of the day (in English) followed by the cardinal of the first week on which to 
  start the query.

  ``#now(weeks=-2, weekday=1)`` returns the Tuesday before last.
  
  ``#now(weekday=MO(2))`` returns Monday after next.

Geo Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Records search APIs accept geofilter parameters to filter in records which are located in a specific geographical area.

The following parameters may be used.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * * Parameter Name
     * Description
   * * distance
     * Limits the result set to a geographical area defined by a circle (coordinates of the center of the circle 
       expressed in WGS84 and distance expressed in meters): latitude,longitude,distance: 
       ``#distance(geo_field, "48.8520930694,2.34738897685,1000")``
   * * polygon
     * Limits the result set to a geographical area defined by a polygon (coordinates of the points expressed in WGS84 
       as in ((lat1,lon1),(lat2,lon2),(lat3,lon3)): 
       ``#polygon(geo_field, "(48.883086,2.379072),(48.879022,2.379930),(48.883651,2.386968)")``
