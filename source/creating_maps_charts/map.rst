Mapping data
============

.. note:: Read how to :doc:`configure visualizations </sourcing_and_processing_data/configuring_visualizations/map>` for a dataset beforehand.

This tool provides a nice interface to extract information from multiple datasets to visualize on a single map.

It is accessible on a top menu link under the codename `Cartograph`.

You start with an empty layer, on which you can add a dataset. You can filter it beforehand using `Filter data`
before selection.
Then you have several options to customize types of points, icons, shapes, or even heat maps.

You can add multiple layers, each layer containing one or more datasets.

Then you can save and share your visualization.

Let's create a layered map of Paris' transport network.


Choose a base map
-----------------

Using this button |mapbox| you can choose the appearance of your base map

See the :doc:`Mapbox integration section </customizing_look_and_feel/basemaps>` for more information.


First layer
-----------

Cartograph creates a first default layer, named `Layer #1` with a default color and icon.

Click on ``Add a dataset to this layer`` to start importing some data to your map.

The list of datasets available will appear: you can search or browse by category to find your datasets.
As usual you can preview and filter the dataset before importing it.
For this example, let's take the public dataset "`Les espaces verts`" from `Open Data Paris`

Click on ``Select`` to conclude the import and see them in your map.

.. tip:: You can filter after importing using the |edit| button. You can iteratively refine your filter!
