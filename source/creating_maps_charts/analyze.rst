Analyzing data
==============

.. note:: Read how to :doc:`configure visualizations </sourcing_and_processing_data/configuring_visualizations/analyze>` for a dataset beforehand.

With the `Charts` tool, you can visualize multiple datasets on a single customized chart.
You can save your charts and easily share them, embed them, or display them as widgets.

.. warning:: Charts currently takes temporal data only (i.e. X axis as dates)


Adding a dataset
----------------

Click on ``Add a dataset to this layer`` to start importing data to your chart.

The list of datasets available will appear: you can search or browse by category to find your datasets.
As usual you can preview and filter the dataset before importing it.
For this example, let's take the public dataset "`Entreprises radi√©es en 2015`" from `Data Infogreffe`
