Using widgets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When editing your page content in expert mode, you may want to use the ODS-Widgets library, which is a set of components, 
available as HTML elements, allowing you to natively integrate data visualizations in your page code, and building interactive
pages by combining widgets together.

The ODS-Widgets library is an open source, AngularJS-based framework developed and maintained by OpenDataSoft on
`GitHub <https://github.com/opendatasoft/ods-widgets>`_. It comes with a complete and comprehenseive
`online documentation <https://opendatasoft.github.io/ods-widgets/docs/>`_.

It can be used directly in your domain's content pages, or in third party Web sites as a standalone toolkit.

.. note::
    Despite being based on AngularJS, the ODS-Widgets is designed to be used as a set of HTML elements, and are therefore entirely
    used in HTML code, with no JavaScript to write. It is therefore usable by anyone with a few notions of HTML, and doesn't require
    development skills. Moreover, many visualizations from OpenDataSoft provide the equivalent widgets code in real time when you use
    them from the portal, so you can learn by starting from the result of a visualization and iterate from there.

On top of all the widgets offered by the `ods-widgets <http://opendatasoft.github.io/ods-widgets/docs/#/api>`_ library,
a few additional directives are available for use within the content pages on the platform. Contrary to the widgets,
these cannot be used on third-party websites for they are tightly coupled with the platform.
