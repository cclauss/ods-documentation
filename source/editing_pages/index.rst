Editing pages
=============

Not only the OpenDataSoft platform allows you to browse and explore configured datasets. You can also use it to build
fully customized content pages, mixing editorial content as well as data visualizations built from your domain's
datasets.

Content pages can be used to:

* Complement and organize your data portal by configuring a home page and by adding topic specific pages.
* Build editorial content directly on the platform and publish it on the Web, as a direct link or through an embed.
* Build dynamic dashboards
