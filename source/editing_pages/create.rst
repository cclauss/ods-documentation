Creating a simple  content page
===================

To create a new content page, go to the *Domain > Portal > Pages* section.

.. ifconfig:: language == 'en'

  .. image:: create__list--en.png
    :alt: Create a content page

.. ifconfig:: language == 'fr'

  .. image:: create__list--en.png
    :alt: Create a content page

Simply hit the **New** button. Once created, the page edition window is displayed.

.. ifconfig:: language == 'en'

  .. image:: create__edit--en.png
    :alt: Edit a content page

.. ifconfig:: language == 'fr'

  .. image:: create__edit--fr.png
    :alt: Edit a content page

Before being able to save a page, you need to configure the page **slug** (*page1* in the example above).

Note that if your domain is configured for multiple user interface languages, you will have to configure your page
content (title, description and page content itself) for all the configured languages.

The template selector lets you select ready to use templates. You can also choose to edit your page in expert mode,
which gives you a very efficient and powerful way to define your page content.

Note that you can switch to expert mode from any template. But once you've switched to expert mode, you cannot go back.

.. ifconfig:: language == 'en'

  .. image:: create__expert--en.png
    :alt: Content page expert mode

.. ifconfig:: language == 'fr'

  .. image:: create__expert--fr.png
    :alt: Content page expert mode

In expert mode, you can independently work on your page content (HTML5) and style (CSS). Javascript code is stripped
from HTML content but as the OpenDataSoft UI framework is based on AngularJS, you can leverage AngularJS bindings
directly in your page's code.

The preview button allows you to visualize the current content of your page, even if you didn't save it.
