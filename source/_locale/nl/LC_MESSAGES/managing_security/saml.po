msgid ""
"Some organizations already have a user directory service that manages their "
"users authentication and permission, and see little value in using the built"
" in OpenDataSoft user management features. In order to address this use "
"case, the OpenDataSoft platform supports external Identity Providers (IdP) "
"through the SAMLv2 standard. This allows for setting up an identity "
"federation between your domain, which will act as a service provider, and "
"this IdP. This federation allows users of your domain to connect to the "
"platform using the identity provider, and if they have one, reuse their "
"active security context to create a SSO mechanism. Such a federation permits"
" user access through 2 different modes: the transient mode, where users are "
"created on the fly when validated by the IdP, and the linked mode, where an "
"OpenDataSoft user account is linked to a SAML identity through a set of "
"properties known by the IdP. Those two modes can coexist on a domain, but a "
"single user can only connect through one mode."

msgid ""
"In the transient mode, every user that has a user account on the IdP trusted"
" by a domain, and doesn't have a OpenDataSoft user account can connect "
"through SAML. A transient user will be created for the user, based on SAML "
"settings for the domain. These settings are the account mapper (the set of "
"IdP-sent parameters that uniquely identify a user) and the the attribute "
"mapper (the parameters that correspond to the user first name, last name and"
" email address). These transient users have the permission to explore the "
"public datasets of the domain. Extra permissions can be given to these users"
" by using the generic ``SAML users`` group. Transient users may not be "
"assigned any special permissions on individual datasets or added to groups "
"(other than the ``SAML users`` group, of which they are automatic members)."

msgid ""
"In the linked mode, users that have an OpenDataSoft user account can link "
"this account to particular values of the set of parameters defined in the "
"account mapper setting. After the link has been established, users who log "
"in through SAML will be logged to their OpenDataSoft user account. Linked "
"users may be assigned the same permissions and added to groups just like "
"normal users (as they are normal users). They are also automatic members of "
"the ``SAML users`` group. This mode allows a more fine-grained permission "
"control, while retaining most of the advantages of the transient mode. The "
"only drawback is the necessity for users to create an account on the domain "
"before linking it to their SAML identity. There are two method for linking "
"an OpenDataSoft user account. The first one is to click on ``Link your "
"account to a SAML account on this domain`` in the identity tab of the user "
"account settings."

"The other method is to create the link during the user account creation "
"process, by clicking the link to complete the registration through SAML. "
"This actually speeds up the user account creation process and allows for a "
"quick account linking."
