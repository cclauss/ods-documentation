"Unsure about what an API is and what it can be used for? We published a "

"An *Application Programming Interface*, or API for short, is an interface "
"designed to let programs exchange data. OpenDataSoft's API provide an "
"unified way of accessing any data that were pushed to the platform, "
"regardless of their source or format, while still enforcing security rules "
"defined by the data owner."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:17
msgid ""
"The whole OpenDataSoft platform relies exclusively on these very APIs to "
"access the data. They are heavily used by our `widgets library "
"<http://opendatasoft.github.io/ods-widgets/docs/#/api>`_ which are only a "
"presentation layer for the data provided by the APIs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:21

"These APIs allow you to search for datasets, search for data, compute "

msgid "Key concepts"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:27
msgid ""
"All APIs will provide you access to the same data, only in different ways. "
"It is very important to be familiar with the nature of this data before "
"diving the full specification of each API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:30
msgid ""
"Everything within the platform is related through a tree structure. Which "
"means that you can think of OpenDataSoft as such:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:33
msgid "The **OpenDataSoft platform** is a network of OpenDataSoft portals."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:34
msgid "A **portal** provides a **catalog** of all of its **datasets**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:35
msgid ""
"Each **dataset** is defined by a dictionary of **metadata**, a **data "
"schema** (specifying fields names and types) and a collection of "
"**records**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:37
msgid "Each **record** provides values for each of the dataset's fields."

"There are of course many more types of data within the platform, but they "
"are only relevant in very specific contexts."

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:41
msgid ""
"The OpenDataSoft platform provides its own API (ODS API v1 and v2) and some "
"standard API's implementations such as ODATA , WFS or CSW."

msgid "ODS API"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:47

"This API is the one used internally by the OpenDataSoft platform and "

msgid "Here is the main differences and key changes between APIv1 and APIv2."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:58
msgid ""
"APIv2 introduces a better implementation of REST principles. Each API entry-"
"point provides links to easily navigate between linked resources (HATEOAS)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:60
msgid ""
"This API proposes a more complete query language with new functions and "
"arithmetic expressions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:61
msgid ""
"Special filters (geofilter or facet filters) are moved to the query language"
" instead. For instance ``geofilter.distance='42,1,100'`` is replaced by "
"``q=distance(geo_field,geom'Point(42 1)',100)``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:63
msgid ""
"Aggregation API (former analyze API) comes with a new ``SQL`` like language "
"and is available on catalog in addition to dataset records."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:65
msgid ""
"Exporters have their own entry-point under ``/api/catalog/exports`` and "
"``/api/catalog/datasets/<dataset_id>/exports``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:66
msgid ""
"Navigation search (former facet search) and standard search are completely "
"splitted."

msgid "Common aspects"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:72
msgid ""
"Both version of the API share one essential mechanism: the "
":doc:`authentification method </using_api/authentication>` which enables you"
" to use the same credentials for both versions."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:78

"These 3 acronyms refer to other standards that the platform implements. If "
"you are not familiar with these standards, then you should stick with the "
"ODS API since it provides the most comprehensive access to the data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:82
msgid "ODATA"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:84
msgid ""
"ODATA is a standard for REST APIs that provide a common language to be used "
"across APIs to perform requests. The trade-off for this norm's generic "
"approach is its higher complexity compared to traditional custom REST APIs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/introduction.rst:87
msgid ""
"OpenDataSoft implements this norm for the simple operations (searching for "
"datasets and records) but the more complex ones (such as analysis, "
"aggregations, geographic computations...) are only available through our V1 "
"and V2 APIs."
