"Before diving into what quotas exist on OpenDataSoft portals, it is "
"important to know that for each portal there is a license that applies. A "
"license is a contract between OpenDataSoft and the portal owners defining "
"how much data can be injected into the portal and the consumption of this "
"data."

#: ../../source/managing_security/quotas.rst:11
msgid ""
"For example, freemium portals can have up to 5 datasets, each having at most"
" 20000 records."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/managing_security/quotas.rst:13
msgid ""
"Your license defines 3 global limits on your portal, the two first ones "
"regulate the amount of data you can inject into the portal while the last "
"one puts an upper limit on the consumption of this data."

"The **number of datasets** quota constraints the total number of datasets "
"currently within the portal (published or not),"

"the **number of records** quota limits to total number of records within "

"lastly, the **number of API calls** quota limits the number of requests made"
" to the data within a given timeframe (usually within a month)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/managing_security/quotas.rst:22
msgid ""
"The number of API calls measure can be a bit difficult to wrap his/her head "
"around since this is a very technical measure of the activity. But it can be"
" summarised as such: everytime somebody accesses your portal, for example "
"the datasets catalog page, the interface will make requests to the portal "
"for the filters values, for the 10 first datasets then the 10 next ones etc."
" Each of these requests is an API call and counted within the quota."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/managing_security/quotas.rst:27

"API calls are therefore made by visitors on your portal, but also by "
"developers using the API to retrieve the data you published and dashboards "
"hosted outside of your portal."

msgid ""
"Since your portal has global upper limits set, you want to avoid having "
"anybody use all of the license quota just by him/herself. You can therefore "
"set general limits on users and if your portal is open to anonymous users, "
"set a different limit for them. You can also set a global limit for all "
"anonymous users to be sure that they won't eat up all of your usage quota."

"You'll be able to set these limits in the **Security** subsection of the "
"**Configuration** section of your portal's backoffice."

msgid ""
"When a user makes a request (be it an API call, a dataset creation of the "
"publication of a dataset), we make sure he/she isn't running into the "
"default limit set for him/her and isn't going over the global portal limit. "
"Were it the case, a message would pop-up telling him/her so."

msgid ""
"Some of your users have specific roles within your organisation that justify"
" their need for quotas larger than the default ones. For example, you may "
"allow registered users to create only a couple of datasets each, but your "
"Chief Data Office will need to be able to publish as many datasets as the "
"license allows."

"In order to do so, you'll have to go to the :doc:`user's management page "
"<users>` or his/her :doc:`group management page <groups>` to set a more "
"appropriate limit for his/her use case."
