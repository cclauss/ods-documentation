"Before diving into the many ways to customize the portal's theme, it is very"

"This is to say that your work has a version number assigned to it and you "
"can at any moment create a new version. You'll always be working on the "
"latest version (think of it as your working draft), but can make any version"
" live (that is, apply it to your portal). Were you to make the latest "
"version live, a new one would be created and would become your new working "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/customizing_look_and_feel/theme.rst:111

"These variables will override the default theme's colors. The custom style "

"To change the style of an element, you only have to find the element's class"

"Both header and footer are wrapped within independent AngularJS "
"applications, which means you can use `ng-if`, `ng-class`, `ng-show`, `ng-"

"dynamic. One common request is to collapse the header into a *click-to-"
"expand* side menu below a certain viewport width. For this purpose we "

"<responsive>` for more information."
