"For now the page isn't really created yet; you need to save it first. Before"
" doing this you need to configure the page **slug** (*page1* in the example "
"above), which is both the page's unique identifier, and the last part of the"
" page's URL (address in the browser)."

"The template selector shows predefined templates that you can directly use. "
"These templates range from very simple layout, with text zones that you can "
"edit directly, to portal homepages presenting the content of the catalog."

"You can also choose to edit the page in **expert mode**, which gives you a "
"direct access to the page's HTML and CSS, allowing you to :doc:`further "
"customize the style of your page </editing_pages/style>`, or to :doc:`build "
"very advanced pages using our OpenDataSoft widgets "
"</editing_pages/dashboard/dashboard>`. You can switch to expert mode from "
"any template, meaning you can use these templates as starting points for "
"dashboards or advanced pages. But once you've switched to expert mode, you "
"cannot go back."

"Once the template is chosen, you can see the two blocks of texts, and you "
"can edit and format the text inside them using a text editor. For example "
"you can type a few paragraphs about your portal in the center block, "
"including headers and parts in bold using the editor. Then a few lines about"
" your city in the right side bar."
