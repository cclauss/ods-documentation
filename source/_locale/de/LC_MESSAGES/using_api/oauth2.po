"OpenDataSoft implements the OAuth2 authorization flow, allowing third party "
"application makers to access the data hosted on a OpenDataSoft platform on "
"behalf of a user while never having to deal with a password, thus avoiding "
"any user credential to be compromised."

"The OpenDataSoft OAuth2 authorization flow is compliant with `RFC 6749 "
"<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749>`_ and makes use of Bearer Tokens in "

"Application developers who want to use the OpenDataSoft APIs with OAuth2 "
"must go through the following steps, which will be explained in this "
"article. They must first register their application with the OpenDataSoft "
"platform. Secondly, they must request approval from users. With that "
"approval, they can request a Bearer Token. This token allows them to query "
"the OpenDataSoft platform APIs for a limited amount of time, after which "
"they must refresh their Bearer Token."
