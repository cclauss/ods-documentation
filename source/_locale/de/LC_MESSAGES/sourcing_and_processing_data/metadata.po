"Metadata is data describing the dataset itself. This is a set of fields "
"describing the data, such as a title, a description, a list of keywords, a "
"modification date, or whether the dataset is compliant to a specific "
"geospatial norm. Adding metadata on a dataset is important to make sure it "
"can be found, understood, and reused by users. In some cases, it can also be"
" important for interoperability, to make sure other systems can understand "
"the content of the dataset."

"basic: this is the information users can see in the \"Informations\" tab of "
"your dataset, and is generally intended to be readable by humans. This "
"includes the title, the license attached to the data... If you want an "
"information to be seen by users on the portal, it should probably be a basic"
" metadata."

"interoperability: metadata usually described in specific standards (such as "
"DCAT or INSPIRE), intended for automatic usage by other systems for "
"interoperability purposes, or for regulatory compliance."

"extra: metadata intended for specific applications, and not expected to be "
"used by users directly. For example, if you configure your default "
"visualizations on the OpenDataSoft portal, this information is stored as an "
"extra metadata. In most cases, you will never have to access or edit them by"
" yourself."
