Monitoring a Domain
===================

Analyzing audience
------------------

There are three main views to analyze your domain, trying to answer three different questions:

- Users: who are the people using your data and with which intensity?
- Data: what is the distribution of the popularity among your datasets?
- Actions: what are people looking to do with your data?

In the Users and Actions view, you can select a period (default is the last week).


If the default KPIs and analyzis are not enough for your needs, you can click on the "See data" link. It allows you to get the whole dataset and do your own analyzis.

Please note that the dataset includes usage data for **at least** the **3 last months**. Older data are archived within the limits indicated by the law and our terms of use.

**API Call.** The key measure of the monitoring is the API call. An API call is one request to the data. It can be made directly via the API or when using one of our services like displaying a map or an analysis. For example when you search for a keyword on a dataset, it generate one request, hence it count as one API call.
