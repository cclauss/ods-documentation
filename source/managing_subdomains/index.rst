Managing subdomains
===================

Subdomains management lets OpenDataSoft customers manage autonomously their own set of domains. A subdomain shares the exact same characteristics as a domain, except that its quotas can be managed from the parent domain (root domain).

Subdomains are made available to OpenDataSoft's customers through a specific, paying, license option. 

Subdomains can be used for different purposes:

* A private company with different business units wanting to manage their own OpenDataSoft instance (domain).
* A local government sustaining an Open Data policy at a regional scale, providing its local cities with an on-the-shelf Open Data platform.

The subdomain creation is managed from the parent domain. Once created, the subdomain owner can:

* Manage its own security policy (users, groups)
* Create and manage datasets and content pages
* Manage the look and feel of its portal

Thanks to the :doc:`Federation </sourcing_and_processing_data/federation>` feature, domains and subdomains can easily share datasets between each other.
